# LexDFS
This repository contains the implementation of general LexBFS algorithm and LexDFS algorithm on chordal graphs. These algorithms are variants of traditional BFS and DFS but have some properties making them useful in different graph problems. For further details, referer to the [Implementation of LexDFS on Chordal Graphs]() paper.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or a compatible version installed. You can check the Python version by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Clone or download the repository

3. Create and activate virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Testing

To run unit tests, run the following command from the root directory:
```bash
